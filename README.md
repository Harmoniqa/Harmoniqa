- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and it's potential to make the world a better place for all.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building an open-source AI tool validated by Pediatricians that adapts to children cognitive capacities and help them learn empathy. This can help create a more harmonious and peaceful world for all.
